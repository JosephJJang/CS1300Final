                    <div class="bio-row-body">
                        <p>Hong is an administrative officer who works in a city in China. He used to be an art teacher and has developed his second career as an amateur artist since then. Now he is the vice president of Anhui Association of Promisinig Young Artists. He has been creating oil paintings for more than twenty years - his work mainly focuses on scenery and landscape paintings.
                        </p>
                        <p>He sees landscape paintings as a conversation between the painter and nature, a way to blend himself in. From replication of the views to reproduction with feelings, from passively observing the scenery, to taking the initiative to feel the light and colors within, he has always tried to merge the feelings and the goodness of humanity into the paintings to reach something that’s unified during his years of practice.
